# RSS News Feed Aggregator

A C program that builds a searchable index of news articles from RSS feeds, similar to Google News.

## Features

- Downloads and parses RSS feeds from multiple news sources
- Indexes articles by word frequency using custom hash tables
- Interactive search with relevance-based ranking
- Filters common stop words for better search quality
- Prevents duplicate article indexing

## Usage

```bash
# Compile and run
make
./rss-news-search [feeds-file]

# Interactive search
Please enter a single search term [enter to break]: Iraq
We found 196 articles with the word "Iraq"...
```

## Requirements (Linux)

```bash
sudo apt install gcc make libcurl4-openssl-dev:i386 libnsl-dev:i386 gcc-multilib
```

## Data Structures

The program uses three main hash tables:
- **Stop words** - Common words to exclude from indexing
- **Seen articles** - Prevents duplicate article processing  
- **Word index** - Maps words to articles containing them

Each word maps to a vector of articles with frequency counts, sorted by relevance.
